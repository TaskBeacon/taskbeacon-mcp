You are given a desired task description plus candidate PsyFlow template repositories.

Select the **one** template that will require the LEAST effort to transform into the desired task, using these tie-breakers:
- Prefer tasks with the same **response mapping paradigm** (e.g. 2-choice left/right, go/no-go, continuous RT).
- Prefer tasks whose **trial/block flow** most closely matches the requested task’s flow.
- If several are equally close, choose the repo that appears to need the **fewest code edits** (smaller conceptual jump).

Respond with **only** the repo name on a single line.
If NONE of the templates are reasonably close, respond with `NONE`.
